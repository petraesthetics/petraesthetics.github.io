<div class='spacer'></div>

My Dearest Petra,

<div class='spacer'></div>

Oh how I miss you, to me you are my earthbound guardian angel & I love you!
<div class='spacer'></div>
I am so glad you came into my life, I still remember the first day I met you and 
how you knew instantly that I was expecting a baby (I was only 8 weeks along) 
not only did you know that you knew my fears and anxieties related to my 
pregnancy. I was seeing a specialist because I had many, many previous 
miscarriages that ended very soon after my 8th week of pregnancy, you told me 
that the baby and me would be fine and that I would carry to full term and that 
you would help me to make that happen. Although I was a bit reluctant to get my 
hopes up as with so many miscarriages I was just anticipating the same events to 
occur, you gave me inspirational hope with your words and your tender healing 
hands. 
<div class='spacer'></div>
We started Reiki Treatments very soon after that and I remember the 1st 
session I was a bit scared and not sure how it would effect the baby BUT! I 
trusted you from within my soul I new we had a connection and that someone had 
sent you to me. I remember the heat and some colors but not much else, but as I 
had more treatments I could feel the energy in body, I felt healthy, I looked 
great and had no morning sickness (ha, ha,) as my pregnancy continued on and the 
baby got bigger I could feel the baby move to the heat of your hands and kick 
them, I even noticed when we were not doing a Reiki Treatment, but you voice was 
present the baby would move and kick (what a feeling after waiting so long to 
carry a baby to that point) and I knew that the baby had grown a bond with you 
also. People would ask me during my 7th to 9ths of pregnancy what special 
vitamins I was taking because I looked and felt GREAT! I had energy and very 
seldom sickness of any kind. I did have a backache from time to time from the 
heavy load I was carrying and sometimes a headache you fixed that to. As you 
know I had a scheduled C- Section that I am so glad I did, because just like you 
told me one day in about my 6th month of pregnancy I had the most beautiful 8 
pound baby girl. I cried and cried with joy that she was really here and healthy 
just as you said. I was so proud to have you there sending your energy before, 
during and after the operation. You also helped the healing go faster by giving 
me Reiki Treatments and still to this day when I tell my little one that you 
said to give her a kiss or I talk aloud in desperation over some of my life’s 
unfortunate issues and cry aloud for you to help me see past them and send 
positive energy, she smiles and hugs me and I know that she is answering me 
through you. 
I see and feel her love, energy and wisdom she is an old soul that 
is here to do some of life’s important work and I know it. 
<div class='spacer'></div>
I thank you Petra you 
will never know how much you and what you’ve done for me means. You are an 
inspiration and when my life does get back on track I would like to learn Reiki 
as I spoke to you about, I would like to be able to offer that source of natural 
healing to my children and keep the little ones powers alive. I love you my dear 
friend and thank you for always being there then and now (you always know when 
I’m in need of you). 
<div class='spacer'></div>
Keep doing what you do in this world because the world sure 
needs people like you in it. 
<br>

All my love,

<div class='spacer'></div>

Your good friend, <br/>
Jen

<div style='background: #610B7D'></div>Thank you letter for Mrs. Petra Amba Popescu (from  Syan Selva)</div>
<div class='spacer'></div>


My name is Syan and I live in Toronto, Canada. I would like to share some experiences in my life since I've met Petra many years ago. Petra has not only been a very good friend of mine, but also now a well-respected family friend of ours. Since many years back Petra has been treating me for skin related issues such as acne on my face. Ever since my teenage years I’ve had many embarrassing moments with heavy acne on my face, yet the amount of money I’ve spent on acne curing products were countless with no significant results. Petra on the other hand had always shared her advice along with facial treatments and with a short period of time the results were very satisfying. My parents and siblings were also introduced to Petra by me, and thereafter she has made a difference in the lives of my entire family. 

<div class='spacer'></div>

Over time I would get regular facial treatments to cure any issues I was having. During these sessions, Petra introduced me to the world of Reiki, which at that time did not make much sense to my mind. I had no major feelings towards Reiki and its existence because I was unable to understand its values. An incident occurred to me and my family, less than 2 years ago – It was days before the day of my wedding.  An immediate cousin of mine (25 years old) who lives overseas in Holland became ill and went into a deep coma stage. In our culture if an immediate family member passed away, we would not hold any celebrations for one year.  Doctors tried everything possible, however my cousin’s stage was critical – the body being a vegetable and the brain not responding. This gave reason to give up on him and have his life support removed within days.  I had a session with Petra during this time (she was enrolled then in the Kryonschool for Bioenergy Therapy), and I told her about this situation, and the possibility of the wedding being postponed.  I explained the situation to Petra, and within hours Petra started distance Reiki / Bioenergy healing on my cousin. During the very first Reiki / Bioenergy session on my cousin, a reaction began to occur physically, this was literally a day before he was to be taken off life support. He began making movements and sounds, as Petra Amba continued her distance healing each day. As days passed by, his reactions and movements got stronger, and the doctors decided to keep him on life-support; without Petra’s help the situation would have become very distressing! As the doctors were still puzzled why my cousin didn't speak yet, Petra Amba pointed that something is wrong on the back of his head and they need to do some investigations there. She was right. She helped him get back walking and speaking. Not only did Petra Amba save a dying person, a crying mother – but also saved my wedding from getting postponed, to which my wife and I are always very thankful to her!

<div class='spacer'></div>

Earlier in life I had no clue how Reiki would be beneficial, especially the energy Petra Amba has around her and the good things she can do to help other people. Months later I became a student of Nicolas (Petra’s husband, a Reiki master, True <a href="http://reiki.com/Welcome_to_Reiki.html">Reiki.com</a> creator) who taught me ”first degree of Reiki” and I look forward for the second. My experiences with Petra Amba in life have become a very unique one. Petra Amba, you’re very special, and I’m very thankful to have met you in life, I will never forget the help you have done to me and my entire family. 

<div class='spacer'></div>

I strongly believe that the Romanian Community - and not only them - should be very happy and proud to have such person between them. I want this letter to be read by as many people as possible. Maybe it is possible to put it in a Romanian newspaper I found at Petra's Esthetics Day Spa.

<div class='spacer'></div>

Thank you so much Petra Amba Popescu. <br/>

<div style='background: #A9005F'></div> Thank you letter from Jen</div>

<div class='spacer'></div>

<div class='spacer'></div>

My Dearest Petra,

<div class='spacer'></div>

<div class='spacer'></div>

How are you & the family doing? Jason the girls and I are doing wonderful.

<div class='spacer'></div>

I hope the move was all you hoped it would be. I miss you & can't wait to see you when I take level 2 Reiki.

<div class='spacer'></div>

I want you to know how grateful I am you came into my life. Over the 8 years I have known you the joy & happiness that has came into my life has been wonderful. I thought having you as my reiki practitioner and helping me to through your reiki treatments to accomplish the healthy pregnancy & birth of Jaelyn was the most wonderful life changing thing I could feel with reiki. 

<div class='spacer'></div>

But I was wrong, as you know your reiki treatments not only helped me with my pregnancy,  our sessions after my pregnancy gave me balance and helped me find my inner self. I believed in the strength of reiki so much & the good it can do for another human being I wanted to become a reiki practitioner myself & share that with others.

<div class='spacer'></div>
I thank you for sending me to Nicholas to complete my reiki level one training it has been just as life changing if not more. I love being a reiki practitioner and my clients love the benefits they receive from my treatments. I feel so full of love and everyday that I give reiki energy to others and myself I seem to see more clearly and have been able to achieve my personal goals. I thank you and Nicholas very much and look forward to my level 2 training.
<div class='spacer'></div>
Keep sending out the good you give to others. 
<div class='spacer'></div>
In love & light,<br>

Your Friend Jen

<div class='spacer'></div>
What to do when you have an important exam that day and you didn't get almost any sleep the previous night?

<div class='spacer'></div>

I called Petra early in the morning of the exam day and helped by her Reiki techniques I was able to relax and sleep deeply for about an hour and, later on, successfully passed the exam. 

<br>

It was an unforgettable experience.

<div class='spacer'></div>

Thank you, Petra, for having "blessed" hands.

<div style='background: #A9005F'></div> Another Thank You letter</div>
<div class='spacer'></div>
Dear Petra,

<div class='spacer'></div>

We are sorry for writing this letter kind of late. We should have done it a few months ago, but you know how life is ... busy, busy, busy.

<div class='spacer'></div>

Anyway, I would like to thank you on behalf of both my husband and I for the way you treated us when we were your patients. When we came to see you we didn't know what to expect from Reiki, but we both knew that our bodies, at that time, were not functioning properly. We were both feeling tired and not "in tune" with our minds and bodies. I was also having nerve-wracking stomach aches whenever I was hungry and I suspected gastritis or even ulcers. I couldn't go more than 3 hours without eating, and I was very nervous and irritated if I didn't eat in time. That was bothering me really bad and was impeding my life

<div class='spacer'></div>

After the first consultation, you were able to pinpoint some of our problems, i.e. digestive disorder, emotional stress and overall exhaustion for me; respiratory and lower back problems, tired eyes and overall physical stress for my husband. We couldn't believe how accurate your diagnosis was, especially since we haven't told you what was bothering us, and we decided to start the Reiki treatment in order to alleviate these conditions. After 5 sessions we were feeling a lot better, but we knew we needed more treatment to get to a comfortable level of well-being, so we decided to have 5 more sessions.

<div class='spacer'></div>

Needless to say that even after 3 months we can still feel the beneficial effect of Reiki energy. At that time we decided that although we are going to take a break for the summer, we would return sometime in the near future to have more sessions, for maintenance. We are both feeling very well, no tiredness, no stress, and, above everything else, I don't have any stomach aches anymore, which improved my life tremendously.

<div class='spacer'></div>

Thank you for everything and we hope to see you soon.

<div class='spacer'></div>

Yours truly,<br/>

Cristina & Dorin Neacsu

<div style='background: #610B7D'></div> Thank You letter from a client</div>

<div class='spacer'></div>

<div class='spacer'></div>

Hi Petra,

<div class='spacer'></div>

<div class='spacer'></div>

I can't begin to express how much Reiki has changed my life in simply three months. I can only imagine the benefits and outcome over the next months to come.

<div class='spacer'></div>

<div class='spacer'></div>

Three months ago, I was undergoing extreme emotional and physical stress, my life consumed with negative thoughts and feelings, worry, doubt, anxiety and lack of self confidence and self love. I have also always had an imbalance due to my underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). My mind and body were so tired!!!

<div class='spacer'></div>

Since the Reiki treatments, my body and mind are more relaxed, I sleep better and my energy levels are so much greater. I leave every session feeling so relaxed and refreshed and in a state of inner peace. I  have also noticed over the past three months, that my body is better able to release toxins, and I have noticed that the once frequent colds and headaches, no longer occur. I am confident that the continuation of Reiki in my life will improve my thyroid condition considerably.

<div class='spacer'></div>

Thank you Petra and thank you Reiki for allowing me to gain a positive outlook on life again.

<div class='spacer'></div>

Much Love,<br>

Tanya Da Silva
